Features
Redux Toolkit Setup
The project includes Redux Toolkit for managing state in a Redux application. The store setup is already configured for easy integration with your components.

**Custom Hooks for Data Fetching**

Custom hooks for fetching data using SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) are provided in the hooks directory. These hooks simplify data fetching in your components by abstracting away common logic.

**Bootstrap Setup**
Bootstrap is integrated into the project for styling. You can easily customize and extend the styles using Bootstrap utilities and components.

**Folder Structure**
The project follows a predefined folder structure to organize your code:

bash
Copy code
/src
  /components     # React components
  /hooks          # Custom hooks
  /redux          # Redux setup (reducers, actions, store)
  /styles         # CSS and SCSS files
  constants.js    # Constants file
  index.js        # Entry point


**Constants File**
A constants.js file is provided to define global constants used throughout the application.
